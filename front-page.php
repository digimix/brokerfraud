		<p>Investors often ask professionals to handle their investment decisions because they lack the expertise to conduct them on their own. In doing so, people place their trust and money in a broker who has a duty to serve their interests. However, this can result in disastrous consequences if a financial adviser engages in wrongdoing or otherwise betrays the client’s confidence. The experienced <a href="stock-fraud-claims.html">stock fraud</a> lawyers at Fitapelli Kurta focus their practice on all aspects of investment fraud and misrepresentation.</p>
		<p>When you suspect misconduct by your broker, our team of securities attorneys will investigate the specific circumstances of your case and guide you through the process of pursuing recovery from any responsible party.</p>

		<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is a federal regulatory and enforcement agency, has set forth guidelines for brokers in conducting investment transactions. These professionals owe their clients a duty of fair dealing, meaning they must disclose certain information, charge prevailing market rates, candidly discuss conflicts of interest, and follow instructions promptly. Furthermore, they must evaluate potential investments according to whether they may be suitable for a client’s particular needs. If these conditions are not met by your investment professional, contact the experienced securities lawyers at Fitapelli Kurta for a case evaluation.</p>
		<p>At its core, the fiduciary duty of a broker requires acting in the best interests of the individuals whom they serve. This means that he or she cannot carry out a transaction solely for the purpose of making a commission, or even take that factor into account when advising an investor.</p>
		<p>Claims against investment professionals may be brought under either state or federal laws, and they often involve fraud, negligence, or both. To establish a claim for fraud, an individual must show that his or her broker made a knowingly false statement with the intention of inducing reliance. It is also necessary to show that the investor did rely on the statement and suffered losses as a result.</p>
		<p>However, you may have a claim even if you are not able to prove the elements of fraud. In this situation, you could still take action against an investment professional who acted carelessly by using a theory of negligence. To succeed as a plaintiff in a negligence claim, an investor must prove that the broker had a duty and breached that duty. Additionally, the plaintiff must show that he or she was harmed by the financial adviser’s breach and incurred damages because of it. In general, the standard to which a broker will be held in a negligence lawsuit is defined as how a reasonably prudent and similarly trained investment professional would behave under the same circumstances.</p>
